# SCRIPT: 8_annotate_narrow.sh
# PURPOSE: Narrow peak annotation and motif analysis for Cut&Tag data
#
# DESCRIPTION:
# This script performs comprehensive narrow peak annotation and motif discovery analysis
# for identified narrow peaks. It annotates peaks with genomic features (promoters,
# introns, exons, etc.) and discovers enriched DNA motifs within narrow peak regions
# using HOMER motif analysis tools.
#
# KEY OPERATIONS:
# 1. Peak annotation using R-based genomic annotation tools
# 2. HOMER motif discovery for TES and TEAD1 peaks
# 3. Motif enrichment analysis with background correction
# 4. Generation of motif logos and statistics
#
# METHODOLOGY:
# - Uses R script for detailed genomic feature annotation
# - Employs HOMER findMotifsGenome.pl for de novo motif discovery
# - Analyzes 200bp regions around peak centers
# - Includes repeat masking for accurate motif identification
# - Compares motifs between different conditions
#
# IMPORTANT PARAMETERS:
# - Memory: 16GB (sufficient for motif analysis)
# - Time: 2 hours (adequate for HOMER processing)
# - Threads: 8 (parallel motif discovery)
# - Motif size: 200bp around peak centers
# - Genome: hg38 reference
#
# INPUTS:
# - Narrow peak files from MACS2 (05_peaks directory)
# - Peak comparison results from previous analysis
# - R annotation script (annotate_peaks.R)
#
# OUTPUTS:
# - Genomic feature annotations (from R script)
# - HOMER motif analysis results (TES_motifs/, TEAD1_motifs/)
# - Motif logos, enrichment statistics, and HTML reports
# - Known and de novo motif discoveries
#
# DEPENDENCIES:
# - R with genomic annotation packages
# - HOMER motif analysis suite
# - Conda environment: annotation_enrichment
#
# USAGE:
# sbatch 8_annotate_narrow.sh
#
# NOTES:
# - Adds "chr" prefix to peak coordinates for HOMER compatibility
# - Includes file existence checks before processing
# - Generates publication-ready motif analysis reports
# - Compares motifs between TES and TEAD1 conditions
