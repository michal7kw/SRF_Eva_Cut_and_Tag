# SCRIPT: 7_compare.sh
# PURPOSE: Peak comparison and visualization analysis for Cut&Tag data
#
# DESCRIPTION:
# This script performs comprehensive peak comparison analysis between different
# conditions (TES, TEAD1) to identify overlapping, unique, and
# condition-specific peaks. It generates statistical summaries and creates
# visualization heatmaps and profiles for comparative analysis.
# NOTE: TESmut samples removed - failed sample
#
# KEY OPERATIONS:
# 1. Peak overlap analysis using bedtools intersect
# 2. Identification of condition-specific peaks
# 3. Generation of peak statistics and counts
# 4. Creation of signal heatmaps using deepTools
# 5. Generation of signal profiles around peak centers
#
# METHODOLOGY:
# - Uses bedtools for efficient genomic interval operations
# - Employs deepTools for matrix computation and visualization
# - Computes signal matrices centered on peak regions (±3kb)
# - Generates both heatmaps and line profiles for visual comparison
#
# IMPORTANT PARAMETERS:
# - Memory: 32GB (for large matrix computations)
# - Time: 4 hours (sufficient for visualization generation)
# - Threads: 16 (parallel processing for matrix computation)
# - Window: ±3kb around peak centers
# - Reference point: Peak center
#
# INPUTS:
# - Narrow peak files from MACS2 (05_peaks directory)
# - Normalized BigWig files (06_bigwig directory)
# - All sample replicates for comprehensive comparison
#
# OUTPUTS:
# - Overlap BED files (TES_TEAD1_overlap.bed, condition-specific peaks)
# - Peak statistics summary (peak_stats.txt)
# - Signal matrix (TES_peaks_matrix.gz)
# - Heatmap visualization (TES_peaks_heatmap.pdf)
# - Signal profile plot (TES_peaks_profile.pdf)
#
# DEPENDENCIES:
# - bedtools (genomic interval operations)
# - deepTools (computeMatrix, plotHeatmap, plotProfile)
# - Conda environment: bigwig
#
# USAGE:
# sbatch 7_compare.sh
#
# NOTES:
# - Focuses on TES peaks as reference for comparison
# - Includes all three conditions and their replicates
# - Generates publication-ready visualizations
# - Statistics help quantify overlap relationships
