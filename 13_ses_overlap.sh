# SCRIPT: 13_ses_overlap.sh
# PURPOSE: To quantify the overlap between experimental ChIP-seq peaks and a
#          pre-defined set of Super-Enhancer Signature (SES) regions.
#
# DESCRIPTION:
# This script performs an intersection analysis to determine the extent to which
# ChIP-seq peaks (both narrow and broad) from different experimental conditions
# co-localize with known SES consensus sites. It handles potential mismatches in
# chromosome naming conventions (e.g., '1' vs 'chr1') and produces detailed
# statistical reports and BED files of the overlapping regions.
#
# KEY OPERATIONS:
# 1. Iterates through all narrow and broad peak files for each sample.
# 2. Standardizes chromosome names in peak files to the 'chr' format (e.g., 'chr1')
#    to ensure compatibility with the SES consensus peak file.
# 3. Uses 'bedtools intersect' to find genomic regions common to both the
#    sample's peaks and the SES peaks.
# 4. Calculates key statistics for each sample:
#    - The number and percentage of the sample's peaks that overlap with SES regions.
#    - The number and percentage of SES regions that are covered by the sample's peaks.
# 5. Generates individual statistics files and a comprehensive summary report.
# 6. Creates combined BED files containing all overlapping regions for downstream
#    analysis or visualization.
#
# METHODOLOGY:
# The core of the analysis relies on 'bedtools intersect' for genomic coordinate
# comparisons. Chromosome name standardization is performed on-the-fly using 'awk'.
# Statistical calculations are done using shell commands like 'wc', 'cut', 'sort',
# and 'bc' for floating-point arithmetic.
#
# IMPORTANT PARAMETERS:
# - SES_CONSENSUS: Path to the BED file containing SES consensus peaks.
# - NARROW_PEAKS_DIR: Directory containing narrow peak files (*.narrowPeak).
# - BROAD_PEAKS_DIR: Directory containing broad peak files (*.broadPeak).
# - OUTPUT_DIR: Directory where all results will be saved.
# - SLURM parameters (--mem, --time, etc.) define computational resources.
#
