=== PAIRWISE OVERLAPS ===
TES-TEAD1 overlapping peaks: 4384
TES-TESmut overlapping peaks: 6647
TESmut-TEAD1 overlapping peaks: 6403

=== CONDITION-SPECIFIC PEAKS ===
TES-specific (vs TEAD1): 13217
TEAD1-specific (vs TES): 6681
TESmut-specific (vs TES): 7218
TES not in TESmut: 10954
TESmut not in TEAD1: 7439
TEAD1 not in TESmut: 4702

=== THREE-WAY COMPARISONS ===
Common to all three conditions: 3177
TES unique (not in any other): 9747
TESmut unique (not in any other): 3998
TEAD1 unique (not in any other): 3532

=== OVERLAP PERCENTAGES ===
TES-TEAD1 overlap %: 24.90% of TES peaks
TES-TESmut overlap %: 37.76% of TES peaks
TESmut-TEAD1 overlap %: 46.25% of TESmut peaks

NOTE: These statistics use high-quality consensus peaks (when available)
      which provide better reproducibility than raw MACS2 combined peaks.
