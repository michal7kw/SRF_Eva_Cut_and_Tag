Date: $(date)
Pipeline: Cut&Tag Analysis for TES/TEAD1
===========================================

SAMPLE GROUPS (TESmut excluded - failed sample):
------------------------------------------------
TES samples (Active): TES-1, TES-2, TES-3
TEAD1 samples (Reference): TEAD1-1, TEAD1-2, TEAD1-3
IgG Controls: IggMs (TES), IggRb (TEAD1)

KEY METRICS TO CHECK:
--------------------
1. Sequencing Quality:
   - Per base sequence quality >30
   - Adapter contamination <5%

2. Alignment Metrics:
   - Alignment rate >80%
   - Properly paired reads >75%
   - Duplicate rate <30% (typical for Cut&Tag)

3. Peak Calling:
   - TES peaks: Expected similar count to TEAD1
   - Peak overlap TES/TEAD1: Expected >50%
