=== ANALYSIS USING HIGH-QUALITY PEAK SETS ===
Peak files used:
  TES: /beegfs/scratch/ric.sessa/kubacki.michal/SRF_Eva_top/SRF_Eva_CUTandTAG/results/11_combined_replicates_narrow/peaks/TES_consensus_peaks_scored.bed
  TEAD1: /beegfs/scratch/ric.sessa/kubacki.michal/SRF_Eva_top/SRF_Eva_CUTandTAG/results/11_combined_replicates_narrow/peaks/TEAD1_consensus_peaks_scored.bed
  NOTE: TESmut removed - failed sample

=== PEAK COUNTS ===
TES total peaks: 17796
TEAD1 total peaks: 11163

=== PAIRWISE OVERLAPS ===
TES-TEAD1 overlapping peaks: 4263

=== CONDITION-SPECIFIC PEAKS ===
TES-specific (vs TEAD1): 13533
TEAD1-specific (vs TES): 6943

=== UNIQUE PEAKS ===
TES unique (not in TEAD1): 13533
TEAD1 unique (not in TES): 6943

=== OVERLAP PERCENTAGES ===
TES-TEAD1 overlap %: 23.95% of TES peaks
TEAD1-TES overlap %: 38.18% of TEAD1 peaks

NOTE: These statistics use high-quality consensus peaks (when available)
      which provide better reproducibility than raw MACS2 combined peaks.
      TESmut samples have been excluded from analysis (failed sample).
