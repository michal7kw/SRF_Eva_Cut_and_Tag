# SCRIPT: idr_analysis.R
# PURPOSE: Irreproducible Discovery Rate (IDR) analysis for Cut&Tag replicates
#
# DESCRIPTION:
# This script performs IDR analysis to assess reproducibility between
# biological replicates. IDR is crucial for ensuring that peaks are
# consistently detected across replicates before downstream analysis.
